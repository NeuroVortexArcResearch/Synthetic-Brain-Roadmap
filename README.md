# Synthetic Brain Research Roadmap  
Long-term direction of NeuroVortexArc Research.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
This roadmap organizes our research into phases, milestones, and experiments needed to approach synthetic cognition and AGI-inspired architectures.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 — Foundations (Month 1–3)
- Define core architecture principles  
- Build Minimal Cognitive Loop (Project #001)  
- Establish synthetic memory model (working + episodic)  
- Publish R&D Note 001, 002, 003  

---

## 🧩 Phase 2 — Modular Intelligence (Month 4–7)
- Agent with internal state & planning  
- Module: Perception → Encoding → Meaning  
- Module: Reasoning micro-cycle  
- Begin neuromorphic toy simulations  

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 — Cognitive Architecture v1.0 (Month 8–12)
- Integrated architecture connecting modules  
- Synthetic memory + reasoning loop working together  
- Early adaptive behavior experiments  

---

## 🌀 Phase 4 — Emergent Behavior & Meta-Learning
- Study self-adjusting patterns  
- Implement primitive meta-learning cycle  
- Explore computational consciousness models (theoretical)  

---

## 📝 Status  
This roadmap evolves as we learn.  
Each milestone will link to its R&D note and experiment repository entry.
